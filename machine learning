Types of Issues
We have structured issues across different difficulty levels, from basic data analysis to advanced model building. Some of the common types of issues include:

Data Preprocessing:

Tasks related to cleaning and organizing datasets, handling missing values, and transforming data.
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features from existing datasets to improve model performance.
Model Building:

Building machine learning models using frameworks like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating models using performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and more.
Optimization & Tuning:

Improving model performance through hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and optimization techniques.
Getting Started
Browse the Issues:

Check the issues section of this repository and look for issues tagged with Machine Learning. These will include tasks specific to this folder.
Choose an Issue:

Pick an issue that aligns with your skill level and interest. Make sure to read the issue description carefully and ask any clarifying questions if needed.
Set Up the Project:

Clone the repository and navigate to the Machine Learning folder:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Ieee-Ras-Muj/Matrix-of-Merges.git
cd Matrix-of-Merges/Machine\ Learning
Install any necessary dependencies mentioned in the project files or issue descriptions.
